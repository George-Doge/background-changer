# background-changer
Just a simple background changer bash script for cinnamon desktop environment.
This is my first endeavour into bash scripting, I just decided to upload it to GitHub, so I wouldn't lose the file, perchance someone might find it useful.

### Setup
- download the `background-changer.sh` and give it proper executable permissions `chmod u+x background-changer.sh`
- Create a directory called `wallpapers` in your home directory. You can manually change the path in the code if you wish to
- Move your favourite wallpapers into the directory and enjoy the script!

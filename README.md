# background-changer
Just a simple background changer bash script for cinnamon desktop environment.
This is my first endeavour into bash scripting, I just decided to upload it to GitHub, so I wouldn't lose the file, perchance someone might find it useful.

### Setup
- download the `background-changer.sh` and give it proper executable permissions `chmod u+x background-changer.sh` if you cannot execute it
- Create a directory called `wallpapers` in your home directory. You can manually change the path in the code if you wish to
- Move your favourite wallpapers into the directory and enjoy the script!

#### Notes
The wallpapers change in the order of their names in the directory. You can rename them so they are shown in whatever order you desire. I might add some features in the future and will fix bugs if some will be found.
